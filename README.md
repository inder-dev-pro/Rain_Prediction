# Rain_Prediction
 I built a rain prediction model using a Kaggle dataset, performing preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categories, and scaling. I trained a Random Forest model, optimizing it with cross-validation. The model achieved impressive accuracy in predicting rainfall, showcasing end-to-end ML, from data preparation to evaluation.
